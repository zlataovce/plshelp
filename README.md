plshelp is an API (and a [website](https://plshelp.mkdev.ml)) for parsing Minecraft server logs which extracts useful information, e.g plugins list, plugin/server errors, server version / software, and more! It even has the ability to share your parsed logs with people too!  

Ready for deploying on repl.it and Heroku!

## Disclaimer

The supported versions are ranging from 1.8.9 to the newest.  
It is not recommended to parse older logs, because they have a different structure and a lot of info may be missing!
## Usage

```
Copy your latest.log file in your minecraft server files / or / upload them to paste.gg

Click [Parse] to parse!

With a simple UI, you can view all of your info easily and share it too!
```
